[Warning: Some of the parameters have no value (beta, sigma_a_bar, cost_b, cost_c,
expi_expk) when using steady. If these parameters are not initialized in a steadystate
file or a steady_state_model-block, Dynare may not be able to solve the model. Note
that simul, perfect_foresight_setup, and perfect_foresight_solver do not automatically
call the steady state file.]
