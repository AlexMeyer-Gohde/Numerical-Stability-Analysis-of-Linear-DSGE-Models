[Warning: Some of the parameters have no value (ccs, cinvs, crdpi)
when using stoch_simul. If these parameters are not initialized in a
steadystate file or a steady_state_model-block, Dynare may not be
able to solve the model. Note that simul, perfect_foresight_setup,
and perfect_foresight_solver do not automatically call the steady
state file.]
